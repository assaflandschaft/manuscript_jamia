    "**By generating multiple sub-questions like above, we can use those to retrieve relevant chunks from our index for each sub-question and combine all the chunks in one place, forming the FullContext. So, the Full Context represents the information from index that is most relevant to answer the original question and will be passed to the LLM (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4) instead of the entire index datafile, which also contains less-relevant information. The LLM will then be asked to use the FullContext to generate an accurate answer for the original question. So, the main thing to notice here, is that we use multiple queries of sub-questions to retrieve chunks from our index but we use only the original main question that is defined in `question_types` list to ask the LLM.**\n",
